        At The Antidote Unisex Salon, we believe style is more than appearance — it’s confidence.
        Inspired by medical precision and attention to detail, our approach treats every haircut
        like a carefully crafted formula designed to enhance your image.

        Founded by Yunes Bhatti, The Antidote was created with one purpose:
        to cure bad style and restore confidence through sharp, modern grooming.
        From precision fades to detailed beard sculpting, every service is delivered
        with discipline, accuracy, and pride.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our environment blends professionalism with creativity —
        clean, focused, and results-driven. We don’t rush cuts.
        We diagnose, design, and deliver.
    </p>

    <p>
        At The Antidote Unisex Salon, you don’t just get a haircut.
        You get the prescription for confidence.
